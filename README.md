# ocean-model-codes
Matlab codes that may be helpful for ocean modeling, including:
- COAWST / ROMS matlab codes **(currently working on these)**
- FVCOM codes for calculating fluxes through a cross section and the estuarine exchange flow. (Many from D. Ralston)
- code to access NIWA's tide model through their API
- matlab wrapper to access pyproj
